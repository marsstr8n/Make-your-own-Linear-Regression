# Build your own Linear Regression 

This is a personal project to help me learn about linear regression, without using automated scikit-learn function

Why this is helpful:
- Actually understand linear regression
- Learn the steps the programs actually goes through

## the two methods:
- Closed-formed solution: Using b0 and b1 (slope and intercept)

- Gradient Descent: iterative approach, used in machine learning
